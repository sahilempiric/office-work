The fruit is dried within 48 hours after harvest to ensure an optimal phytochemical profile and the superior quality of Euromed’s saw palmetto extract, which is the result of decades of research to help support prostate health.Each production batch, from the herb to the final extract, undergoes multiple laboratory tests for identity, potency and quality, a process certified by PhytoProof®, Euromed’s seal of quality. PhytoProof® extracts are highly bioavailable and provide tangible, reproducible results in clinical testing and are in line with consumer expectations.In 2018, Euromed inaugurated its new Research and Innovation Center in Barcelona with the aim of strengthening its established leadership position in the production of the highest quality herbal extracts using state-of-the-art technologies. This commitment to quality includes the research as well for more sustainable and cleaner extraction methods and the development of further innovative herbal extract solutions. This major investment was not only associated with significant investments in technology, but also in additional qualified experienced personnel.The newest production facility in Murcia, Spain, was acquired from Probelte Biotechnologies in 2017, expanding Euromed's capabilities with environmentally friendly technologies such as the Pure-Hydro Process®, a proprietary extraction technology using only ultra-pure water. This production facility is mainly dedicated to Euromed's line of Mediterranean fruit and vegetable extracts™ and supports our philosophy of sustainability by extracting fruit and vegetables from the Mediterranean region, which are grown and harvested in a sustainable manner close to the production site, thus reducing the company's carbon footprint.Five decades of experience are available to the global health ingredients industry that strives for consistent standardisation of every production batch, full traceability, identity, purity, safety and evidence-based efficacy.Commitment to environmental sustainability is one of the core values at Euromed and part of the company's DNA. The Barcelona and Murcia extraction facility are the recipients of seven industrial certifications, including ISO 14001 for environmental sustainability.

However, their focus goes a step forward. Their goal is to preserve and regenerate the Earth while optimizing the health and well-being of its inhabitants.Beginning with an evaluation of the entire supply chain, Natac analyses the agricultural processes that use botanical resources to understand what points of the production process have potential for intervention and investment.

Their partnerships with local farmers, low-emission technology, and coordination with the regional environment are some of the reasons why Hervás is the most efficient botanical ingredients factory in the world.Hazard Analysis Botanical Identity (HABOID)HABOID is Natac’s full-proof method for the botanical identification of plant materials. It starts with nine questions that evaluate the raw material’s risk for contamination such as, where and how the plant was cultivated, if similar species of the plant exist, and how high the possibility of cross-contamination is. These questions help scientists classify the starting material’s risk for adulteration into one of three categories: low, medium, and high-risk. Each of these categories is associated with a certain set of tests that range from simple macroscopic and organoleptic tests, all the way to HPLC and genetic evaluation for high-risk plants. This system guarantees 100% botanical purity.CERTIFICATIONSNatac’s products are upheld to a level of quality that exceeds the most rigorous standards in the industry.

The strain is isolated from camembert and used as a producer of ClpB, a protein that mimics satiety hormone alpha-MSH and was found inversely correlated to BMI in several cohorts.EnteroSatys® is on the market in France, Portugal, Italy, and Croatia to date (2022) and is shown to increase satiety and support weight loss and a healthier metabolism in preclinical studies, a randomized, multicentric, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in 230 overweight adults, and in consumer surveys. Participants using Hafnia alvei had a significantly higher feeling of fullness, further reduction in weight loss and hip circumference, and improved glycemia and cholesterolemia.EnteroSatys is winner of the NutraIngredients Award as Best Probiotic of the Year 2021 and Best ingredient in the weight management category in 2019.We also developed, in partnership with the Institute of Functional Genomics in Lyon, a product for children's growth branded Crescylia based on a specific strain, L. plantarum WJL, increasing peptidase gene expression in the gut, and optimizing protein uptake. This strain has great potential including in sports nutrition, healthy aging, and animal feed and won the NutraIngredients Award as Best Nutrition Research Project of the year in 2021.Our 3rd technology is based on two strains producing peptides exerting molecular mimicry to oxytocin, the hormone of love and attachment, leading to significant improvements in anxious and depressive behaviors in mice.Our science, products, and positionings are protected by 10 families of patents.TargEDys is now looking for partners for international distribution."
